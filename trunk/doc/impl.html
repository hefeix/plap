<center><h3>Probabilistic Learnng of Programs: Implementation</h3</center>

sane C++ project guidlines
nested namespaces
relative-path includes
no macros allowed in .h files
uniform naming conventions
const-correct
80-cols
never have a pointer-to-a-pointer
never have pointers in an API


variant<AdaptableFunctor<

complexity_bound in knobs will need to be replaced

selection doesn't seem to be working - dump the new pops vs. old pops?

point size in variant, leaves vs. internal nodes?

new tree spec
cloning a representation by paralel iteration as a test-case
mvt replacement
tr[0][1][0] -> first child of second child of first child
should be able to handle contin representation
tree should be partially sorted (i.e. some nodes may be sorted)
AST - a program tree always in canonical (reduced?) form
need a bootiful syntax for writing out trees-of-anything


for rewrite impl look at norvig p. 188
rules
list-of-rules
matching engine
matching consequence
copy norvigs test problems too
factorize and unfactorize and take the smallest (2*x+2*y) vs 2*(x+y)

total functional programming
