Data Types for Artificial General Intelligence

Most programming languages attribute data types to sequences of bits and
positions in memory to indicate what the data are intended to represent. What
sort of type system is appropriate for a programming system designed to operate
under the assumption of insufficient knowledge and resources, carrying out
program induction?

To answer this question, let's break down the various things types are used
for:

1) To reduce fundamental failures such as segmentation faults.
2) Data abstraction (i.e. maintaining invariants)
3) Data annotation
4) performance

 to
avoid certain classes of bugs (both at compile time and at run time), to ai
