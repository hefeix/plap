<h4>Preliminaries</h4>

<ul>

  <li>Unless otherwise specified, a sequence of entities may be empty, and the
  entities themselves are separated by whitespace.</li>
  
  <li>Whitespace is one or more spaces and/or tabs. Unless otherwise specified,
  any ammount of whitespace may occur between any two consecutive
  entities.</li>

  <li>A name is an identifier or a scalar.<ul>

    <li>An identifier is a nonempty sequences of digits, letters, and
    underscores, not beginning with a digit, containing no whitespace, that is
    not a keyword. A keyword is any word appearing in <tt>codeface</tt> in this
    document.</li>

    <li>A scalar is dollar sign (<tt>$</tt>) followed by an identifier, with no
    intervening whitespace.</li>

  </ul>

  <li>Matched parentheses (<tt>(</tt> and <tt>)</tt>) may be placed around any
  entity. Any entity that contains whitespace and is nested inside another
  entity <i>must</i> be put in parentheses.</li>

</ul>

<h4>Core Syntax</h4>

A program is a sequence of expressions and imports, each separated by one or
more newlines.<ul>

  <li>An expression is a name, a literal, or a function application<ul>

    <li>A literal is a Boolean literal, number literal, character literal, or
    nil.<ul>

      <li>A Boolean literal is <tt>true</tt> or <tt>false</tt>.</li>

      <li>A number literal is a nonempty sequence of digits (<tt>0-9</tt>),
      optionally preceded by a minus sign (<tt>-</tt>), optionally containing 
      exactly one period (<tt>.</tt>) in some position other than
      the last, containing no whitespace.

      <br><i>Examples:</i> <tt>-3.14</tt>, <tt>2003.0</tt>, <tt>.5</tt>,
      <tt>42</tt>, <tt>109</tt>, <tt>-00</tt></li>

      <li>A character literal is a normal character literal or an escaped
      character literal.<ul>
	
	<li>A normal character literal is single quote (<tt>'</tt>), followed
	by a single character other than a single quote or a hash (<tt>#</tt>),
	followed by a single quote.</li>

	<li>An escaped character literal is a single quote, followed by a
	backslash (<tt>\</tt>), followed by a <tt>t</tt> (tab), <tt>n</tt>
	(newline), <tt>#</tt>, <tt>\</tt>, <tt>'</tt>, or <tt>"</tt>.

	<br><i>Examples:</i> <tt>'a'</tt>, <tt>'\n'</tt>, <tt>'\\'</tt></li>

      </ul></li>

      <li>Nil is an empty pair of brackets (<tt>[]</tt>), or the keyword
      <tt>nil</tt>.</li>
    
    </ul></li>

    <li>A function application is an identifier, followed by a nonempty
    sequence of expressions.

    <br><i>Examples:</i> <tt>foo 1 2 'x' (bar $x)</tt>, <tt>bla ()</tt>,
    <tt>baz 3.4 [] 1 2 3 []</tt></li>

  </ul></li>

  <li>An import is the keyword <tt>import</tt>, followed by an expression.

  <br><i>Examples:</i> <tt>import ants</tt>, <tt>import blocksworld</tt></li>

</ul>

<h4>Syntactic Sugar</h4>

<p>Every combo program may be expressed using nothing but the core syntax. For
convenience however, the following syntactic sugar is provided. Every sugared
program corresponds to exactly one unsugared program.</p>

<h5>Special operators</h5>

<p>A number of special operators (primaily infix, but some prefix as well) are
provided; each is equivalent to some function application expression. The
operators are listed in ascending order of precedence. The arity of an
expression may be the same for both forms or may be different, as indicated in
the table. Infix operations of equal precedence are left-associative, except
for <tt>pair</tt> (<tt>,</tt>) and <tt>cons</tt> (<tt>:</tt>), which are
right-associative.</p>

<h5>String literals</h5>

<p>A string in double-quotes, with same escape-sequences recognized in
character literals, is sugar for the equivalent list of characters. So for
example <tt>"foobar"</tt> is equivalent to <tt>['f', 'o', 'o', 'b', 'a',
'r']</tt>, and <tt>"b'la\"bla"</tt> is equivalent to <tt>['b' '\'', 'l', 'a',
'"', 'b', 'l', 'a']</tt>, etc.</p>


<h5>Comments</h5>

<p>Comments begin with a <tt>#</tt> and run until a newline is reached, with
the exception of escaped <tt>#</tt>s within string literals, which do not begin
comments. Whenever a comment appears it is equivalent to the empty string.</p>

<h5>Significant indentation</h5>

<p>Note that since newlines are not considered whitespace, every expression
that uses only the core syntax must be one a single line. To stretch an
expression over multiple lines without otherwise affecting parsing, newlines
may be escaped (i.e. ended with a backslash). An escaped newline is treated as
a single character of whitespace.</p>

<p>Indentation may also be used to control parsing and expression grouping,
according to the following simple rules:

<ol>

  <li>A line that is indented at the same level or a level less than that of
  the line above it creates <i>n+1</i> right-parens (<tt>)</tt>) at the
  begining of the line, where <i>n</i> is the number of levels it decreases the
  indentation by.</li>

  <li>A line that is indented (and immediately below a line containing an
  expression or part of an expression) is parsed as part of that expression,
  and creates a left-paren (<tt>(</tt>) at the begining of the line. This
  left-paren appears after any right-parens that might appear from applying
  rules one and two.</li>

  <li>Lines that end in a comma are have their newlines escaped in the same
  manner as lines ending in a backslash, overriding the above rules. Note that
  unlike a backslash, a comma ending a line is not ignored, but is considered
  as part of the input.</li>

  <li>If the final line in an expression is indented <i>n</i> levels, <i>n</i>
  right-parens are created at the end of the line.</li>

</ol>

<p>Note that by rule one, indentation levels must match - if we first indent by
two spaces, and then by two more, we can indent the following line by two or
four spaces, or more than four spaces, but not by one or three spaces. Every
increase in indentation corresponds to a single new indentation level,
regardless of the number of whitespace characters it increases indentation
by.</p>

<h4>Bound and Unbound Names</h4>

Every expression containing no unbound variables has a well-specified type. The

   <li>The type of an integer literal is <tt>int</tt>.</li>
   
   <li>The type of a float literal is <tt>float</tt>.</li>

   <li>The type of a character literal is <tt>char</tt>.</li>

   <li>The type of a list literal is <tt>list</tt>.</li>

   <li>The type of the unit literal is <tt>unit</tt>.</li>

   <li>The type of a function application is its return type for the sequence
   of types of its arguments (see below).</tt>

   <li>The type of a list expression is <tt>list</tt>.</li>

   <li>The type of a let expression is the type of its expression argument,
   given all of its declaration and rewrite arguments bound to their
   names.</li>
