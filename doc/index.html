<blockquote> <i>Can we design programming languages containing machine learning
primitives?</i> Can a new generation of computer programming languages directly
support writing programs that learn? In many current machine learning
applications, standard machine learning algorithms are integrated with
hand-coded software into a final application program. Why not design a new
computer programming language that supports writing programs in which some
subroutines are hand-coded while others are specified as "to be learned." Such
a programming language could allow the programmer to declare the inputs and
outputs of each "to be learned" subroutine, then select a learning algorithm
from the primitives provided by the programming language. Interesting new
research issues arise here, such as designing programming language constructs
for declaring what training experience should be given to each "to be learned"
subroutine, when, and with what safeguards against arbitrary changes to program
behavior.  - Tom Mitchell, <a

<h4><u>Summary and Disclamer</u></h4>

This is not a complete design for an <a href =
"http://www.agiri.org/wiki/index.php?title=Artificial_General_Intelligence">
artificial general intelligence</a> (AGI). It <i>is</i> a set of core
components that, with future augmentation, will lead to a complete AGI
design. The current system is essentially intended to function as a
read-eval-print loop for an unusual Lisp dialect (Combo Lisp). This language is
based on probablistic semantics, and operates under assumptions of insufficient
knowledge and resources. When no definite answer to a user's query is
available, the Probabilistic Learning And Programming (Plap) System (comprising
Combo Lisp and its attendant libraries as described herein) can return
speculative answers synthesized through program induction, analogical mapping,
and/or inference.
