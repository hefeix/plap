and Resources</h1></center>

<h4><u>Quantifying insufficient knowledge with truth values</u></h4>

As a consequence of insufficient knowledge, we cannot assume that all mappings
in the system are correct. Formally, declarations are considered as logical
propositions, with truth values representing the system's degree of belief in
the truth of the corresponding proposition. Furthermore, there may be
conflicting partial evidence; one source of knowledge may indicate that <tt>foo
42 := 5</tt>, while another source indicates that <tt>foo 42 := 9</tt>. Note
that this sort of uncertainty is entirely <i>within</i> the formal language; we
don't know the value of <tt>foo 42</tt>, but we are speaking of a certain,
crisp <tt>foo</tt>, one that maps natural numbers to natural numbers (for
example).<br><br>

This sort of uncertainty may be quantified by attaching <i>truth values</i> to
declarations. Truth values may be considered to occupy a (potentially
n-dimensional) continuum from absolute falsehood (which we may continue to
represent by the constant <tt>false</tt>) to absolute truth (<tt>true</tt>).
Syntactically, we will now say:

<pre>foo 42 := 5 ? some_truth_value;</pre>

The former "crisp" declaration <tt>foo 42 := 5;</tt> is equivalent to
specifying absolute truth. So while

<pre>
foo 42 := 5;
foo 42 := 9;
</pre>

is a mistake,

<pre>
foo 42 := 5 ? uncertain_truth_value1;
foo 42 := 9 ? uncertain_truth_value2;
</pre>

is perfectly acceptable, and indeed leads to a quite natural representation of
many real-world scenarios (for example, a robot with two noisy sensors that
give conflicting values for the same underlying variable).<br><br>

Truth values must be pure expressions.

<h4><u>Quantifying insufficient resources with costs</u></h4>

As a consequence of insufficient resources, we cannot assume that the system
will be able to maintain all declarations in memory, or will have enough time
and/or space to evaluate all expressions using the most accurate methods. To
intelligently prioritize which evaluation methods to apply requires us to
estimate, for each dec

two types
of information on the level of declarations: (1) an estimate of the resources
required to evaluate the (right-hand-side) expression; and (2) an estimate of
the accuracy of the result. Similarly, to intelligently prioritize which
information to keep in memory requires, per-declaration: (1) an estimate of the
resources required to keep the declartionin memory; (2) an estimate of the
importance of keeping the declaration for the computation of current and future
result; and (3) an estimate of the accuracy of the result.


<br><br>



information to keep in memory
may be presented with a
set of tasks to perform together with a resource limit, and only sufficient
resources to carry out a fraction of them. Utilities are attached to
declarations to indicate the degree of belief in the proposition that expending
resources on declaration will help the system achieve its goals.<br><br>

Analogous to truth values, we will now say:

<pre>
foo bar := baz % uncertain_utility_value;
</pre>

To attach an uncertain utility value to a statement (with the default case
assuming that a declaration will certainly help the system achieve its goals,
and e.g. should never be removed from the system).


<h4><u>Making Decisions</u></h4>


<h4><u>Subjective Logic</u></h4>

My tentative proposal is to use <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjective_logic">Subjective Logic</a> as
the representational scheme for both truth values and utility values. Briefly,
a

relative atomicity may be assumed to be 0.5 for atomic propositions - for
compound logical propositions this may be explicitly computed, e.g. if we have
weak evidence that fred is either a liar or a thief or both, we can say

prop_or (liar fred) (thief fred) ? (0.1 0 0.9 0.75)

maybe there should be a continuum of fast-to-slow memory where less important
things are stored lower down? Can this relate to processor usage?
