What's Missing?

Deliberately:

* Namespaces/Modules
* Pattern Matching (ala "f $x:[] = [], f $x:$y = f $y")
* 

superficial and of use only to the human programmer

For now:

lets
lambdas
nested definitions

how to handle def at parsetime and runtime???

todo: add definition of a constant (x = bla)

to make rules for paren-insertion consistent, should augment parser with
cl-style "a b (c d)" -> a(b c(d))"
