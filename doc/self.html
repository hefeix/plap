AIXI and AIXItl are an idealized models of "optimal intelligence" based on
program induction. An important limmitation of this paradigm is that AIXItl
cannot model e.g. its circuits being scrambled - the internals of operation are
behind an opaque curtain with the rest of the universe on the other side (thank
to Eliezer Yudkowsky for this insight).<br><br>

Language allows us to reason about such modifications (including deliberate
self-modification), e.g. what if I become someone else?
